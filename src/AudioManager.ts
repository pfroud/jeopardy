    In the Jeopardy TV show, three low-pitch beeps happens in TWO situations:
        (1) Someone buzzes but does not answer within five seconds.
        (2) Time runs out with no buzzes.
    Source video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGSDLZ5wqy8

    I am doing the sounds slightly differently. In situation (1), 
    I'm playing the same sound that plays when someone answers wrong.

    Eight high-pitch beeps, short pause, eight high-pitch beeps
    happens only when the round runs out of time.

    (I am using this sound correctly.)

    If you're having trouble getting sounds to work:
        - If you've installed the browser extension called "Disable HTML5 Autoplay",
          disable it for this domain.
        - You might also want to go to Site Settings (chrome://settings/content)
          and set 'Sound' to 'Allow' for this domain.
